      <description>Introduction A few days ago I was writing about injecting FridaGadget.dylib inside application on nonjailbroken device so I was thinking why not to do the same thing, just with custom code (code injection).
The idea was to change some functionality of original application using dynamic library (dylib). Links for application are on my github and links are below.

      <description>Introduction After trying for 7.30 hours to insert FridaGadget into the application, I have finally did it. It took reading bunch of tutorials and trials until it all clicked.
Anyway, FridaGadget allows us instrumentation (lets say hacking) of an application on non jailbroken iPhone. I was using my iPhone which is running iOS 14.0.1.
