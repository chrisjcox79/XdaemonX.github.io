      <description>Introduction I know this is not about MacOS nor iOS but this was something that had to be written.
Recently I had a web application penetration test on which I have found CSV injection and a great example of bypassing PHP image upload. Users with admin privileges had an option to change user&amp;rsquo;s profile picture which immediately caught my eye.
App details  Fictional hostname: example.com Language: PHP Framework: Laravel  Analysis After messing around with trying to upload some php shell I was constantly getting 500 Internal Server Error which was kinda a clue to me that application is not allowing anything besides good ol&amp;rsquo; images.</description>

      <description>We have all been playing with cycript and changing those labels or perhaps we hid some views but we did not see the bigger picture of all of it, and the biggest question of them all is how it is related to class-dump and theos. To make things clear, im gonna take local news app.
Theos Lets take definition from iphonedevwiki which says:
 Theos is a cross-platform suite of development tools for managing, developing, and deploying iOS software without the use of Xcode.</description>

      <description>The first time I have tried to debug iOS apps on my jailbroken iPhone I hit the wall. There were many issues I had to solve so in this short post I&amp;rsquo;m gonna try to help you with this.

Prerequisites:
 Jailbroken iPhone (mine is iPhone 11, 13.</description>
