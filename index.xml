      <description>Introduction A few days ago I was writing about injecting FridaGadget.dylib inside application on nonjailbroken device so I was thinking why not to do the same thing, just with custom code (code injection).
The idea was to change some functionality of original application using dynamic library (dylib). Links for application are on my github and links are below.

      <description>Introduction After trying for 7.30 hours to insert FridaGadget into the application, I have finally did it. It took reading bunch of tutorials and trials until it all clicked.
Anyway, FridaGadget allows us instrumentation (lets say hacking) of an application on non jailbroken iPhone. I was using my iPhone which is running iOS 14.0.1.

      <description>Introduction Let&amp;rsquo;s first start by giving description of Modlishka and lateralus.
Modlishka Modlishka is basically a reverse proxy which can be used to bypass 2FA, collect credentials and generally is helpful for phishing campaigns.
It has a lot of options, such as:
 Injecting custom javascript code (can be useful to rewrite parts of page) Substitutions of strings Credentials collection Domain mode hijacking  Here I will show only some parts of it, you should download it and give it a try.</description>

      <title>Fun RCE with PHP upload</title>

      <description>Introduction I know this is not about MacOS nor iOS but this was something that had to be written.
Recently I had a web application penetration test on which I have found CSV injection and a great example of bypassing PHP image upload. Users with admin privileges had an option to change user&amp;rsquo;s profile picture which immediately caught my eye.
App details  Fictional hostname: example.com Language: PHP Framework: Laravel  Analysis After messing around with trying to upload some php shell I was constantly getting 500 Internal Server Error which was kinda a clue to me that application is not allowing anything besides good ol&amp;rsquo; images.</description>

      <title>Connecting the dots between Theos and Cycript/Cyrun</title>

      <description>We have all been playing with cycript and changing those labels or perhaps we hid some views but we did not see the bigger picture of all of it, and the biggest question of them all is how it is related to class-dump and theos. To make things clear, im gonna take local news app.
Theos Lets take definition from iphonedevwiki which says:
 Theos is a cross-platform suite of development tools for managing, developing, and deploying iOS software without the use of Xcode.</description>

      <description>The first time I have tried to debug iOS apps on my jailbroken iPhone I hit the wall. There were many issues I had to solve so in this short post I&amp;rsquo;m gonna try to help you with this.

Prerequisites:
